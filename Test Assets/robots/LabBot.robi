# robi description file for the EyeBot simulator EyeSim 6.0
# by Andreas Koestler, Thomas Braunl, 2004

# EyeSim 5.0 by Axel Waggershauser, Thomas Braunl, 2002
# inspired by the parameter file for EyeSim 1.0 by
# Thomas Braunl - Ghee Ong - Nicholas Tay, 1998

# the format: valid lines contain a keyword followed by a list of
# parameters seperated by white space. every line not starting with
# a keyword is ignored.

# every parameter describing a length is specified in milli meter
# every parameter describing a angle is specified in degree


# the name of the robi, the used string is the rest of the line
# behind the keyword without the surrounding white space
name LabBot

# robot diameter mm
diameter 260

# max linear velocity in mm/s
speed    600

# max rotational velocity in deg/s
turn     300

# the file name of the OpenInventor model used for this robi
model LabBot.obj

# axis is the distance between the center of the robi and the center of
# the robis axis, e.g. a value of 0 means the axis is in the center of
# the robi, if no value is given, it is set to 0.
axis 00 23

# id-num has to match file "hdt.h"
# "psd", name, id, relative position to robi center(x,y,z) in mm, angle in x-y plane in deg
