# the format: valid lines contain a keyword followed by a list of
# parameters seperated by white space. every line not starting with
# a keyword is ignored.

# every parameter describing a length is specified in milli meter
# every parameter describing a angle is specified in degree

# axis is the distance between the center of the robi and the center of
# the robis axis, e.g. a value of 0 means the axis is in the center of
# the robi, if no value is given, it is set to 0.
