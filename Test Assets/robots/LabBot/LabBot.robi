# robi description file for the EyeBot simulator EyeSimVR 1.0

# EyeSim 5.0 by Axel Waggershauser, Thomas Braunl, 2002
# inspired by the parameter file for EyeSim 1.0 by
# Thomas Braunl - Ghee Ong - Nicholas Tay, 1998

# the format: valid lines contain a keyword followed by a list of
# parameters seperated by white space. every line not starting with
# a keyword is ignored.

# every parameter describing a length is specified in milli meter
# every parameter describing a angle is specified in degree
# angles are rotations about axis. Z is forwards, Y is up, X is right

# motors and encoders for low level drive routines
# Diff.-drive: left motor, left encoder, right motor, right encoder
drive DIFFERENTIAL_DRIVE

# the name of the robi, the used string is the rest of the line
# behind the keyword without the surrounding white space
name "LabBot2"

# robot mass
mass 50 0 30 -50

# model path, x y z offset, rotation about x y z axis
model LabBot.obj 14 0 0 0 90 0

# collider Size x y z Centre x y z
collider box 180 145 200 0 82 0
collider capsule 10 50 0 25 -60

# axis is the distance between the center of the robi and the center of
# the robis axis, e.g. a value of 0 means the axis is in the center of
# the robi, if no value is given, it is set to 0.
# axis y (vertical) z (forward)
axis 22.7 10.8

# psd sensor definition:
# id-num has to match file "hdt.h"
# "psd", name, id, relative position to robi center(x,y,z) in mm, angle in x-y plane in deg
